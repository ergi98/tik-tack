## Project Title

Tic-Tac-Toe. [Tap here to play.](https://tik-tack.vercel.app/)

## About the Project

A very minimalistic UI for a tic-tac-toe game.

**Objective and Inspiration:**

My main focus for this project was to practice my animation skills. I tried to create a very minimalistic UI equipped with subtle animations for every user interaction.

**Key Features:**

- **Different game modes:** You have the ability to play vs a friend or vs the computer.
- **Responsive Design:** Can be played on any screen size, desktop or mobile, and is also available as a PWA.
- **Scoreboard:** Keeps track of how many times each side has won.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Very easy to navigate and intuitive UI.
